      "title": "Frequently asked questions",
      "q1": "What is lead deduplication?",
      "a1": "It's the process of identifying and unifying duplicate records. LeadVault detects duplicates by email, phone or external_id and merges them automatically, ensuring each lead exists only once in the workspace.",
      "q2": "How does LeadVault prevent duplicate leads?",
      "a2": "Through idempotency keys per source and identity normalization. If the same event is sent more than once, the idempotency key prevents duplication. Similar identities (email, phone) are detected and unified automatically.",
      "q3": "Can I send leads to any CRM or tool?",
      "a3": "Yes. LeadVault delivers via webhooks with HMAC signing. Any system that accepts HTTP POST with JSON payload can be configured as a destination — CRM, email marketing, Slack, internal tools or custom APIs.",
      "q4": "What happens if the destination goes down?",
      "a4": "LeadVault retries automatically with exponential backoff. If all attempts fail, the event is moved to the Dead Letter Queue (DLQ), from which it can be resent manually or in batch when the destination is back.",
      "q5": "How does workspace isolation work?",
      "a5": "Each workspace is an isolated environment with its own sources, leads, destinations and members. Data from one workspace is not accessible by another. Ideal for separating clients, projects or environments.",
      "q6": "Does LeadVault replace my form or CRM?",
      "a6": "No. LeadVault is an intermediary layer. Your forms keep working and your CRM remains the final destination. LeadVault centralizes capture, ensures data quality and delivers reliably.",
      "q7": "How do I start using the beta?",
      "a7": "Click \"Try it now\" to create your account. You'll have immediate access to the capture endpoint, deduplication, audit trail and delivery. The documentation includes integration examples for the most common scenarios.",
      "q8": "Is there delivery replay and audit?",
      "a8": "Yes. Every delivery is recorded with status, attempts and HTTP response. Failed deliveries can be reprocessed individually or in batch. The timeline shows the complete history of each lead, including all delivery attempts."
